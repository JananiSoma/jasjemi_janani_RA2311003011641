ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN BACTERIA

PROBLEM : 
Antibiotic resistance is a growing global health crisis, where bacteria evolve mechanisms to survive exposure to antibiotics, rendering standard treatments ineffective. This phenomenon poses a significant challenge to public health, as it leads to higher medical costs, prolonged hospital stays, and increased mortality. 

SOLUTION : 
A machine learning model could be trained on a dataset available based on the antibiotic resistance for the bacteria Nisseria gonorrhoea versus the antibiotics Tetracycline, Cefixime, Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin and Ciprofloxacin. The accuracy of the model could point to the the efficacy of the particular antibiotic against the bacteria, the ones with higher accuracy are the most effective to mitigate and fight against the bacteria. 

A webpage could also be developed to display the results from the machine learning model for easy access, one bacteria at this point in time, but could be expanded to various other bacteria known to develop a resistance.
